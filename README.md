# MACHINE LEARNING FOR PREDICTING THE DYNAMICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES THROUGH PHYSICS INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS

In the past few years, approaches such as Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to a variety of applications that can be modeled by linear and non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. Specifically, this work builds on the application of PINNs to an SIRD compartmental model and expand it to build mathematical models that incorporate transportation between populations and their impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases. Our work employs neural networks that are capable of learning how diseases spread, forecasting their progression, and finding their unique parameters. We show how these approaches are capable of predicting the behavior of a disease described by governing differential equations that include  parameters and variables associated with the movement of the population between neighboring cities. We show that our model validates real-data and also how such PINNs based methods predicts optimal parameters for given datasets.
